NOT OPTIONAL:
You MUST import the Dialoguer and Dialoguer/Output folders in order for Dialoguer to function properly.

OPTIONAL:
You can remove the DialoguerExamples folder, as it contains example dialogue skins. It is recommended that you create your own dialogue skins for your game, but feel free to use the examples included if you so choose!

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at tony@wilder.games


! UPGRADING TO 2019.3 !
-----------------------
Pre 2019.3, DialoguerOutput was storred in the Assets/ root folder.
This entire folder is now located at Dialoguer/Output. When upgrading,
simply import the new Dialoguer package, then move the CONTENTS of
your old Assets/DialoguerOutput to the new Assets/Dialoguer/Output/
Overwrite existing files if necessary.

Hope that helps! :)
